# About Me

<img src="/images/jasonansel4.jpg" class="floatpic" width="200" height="300">
My name is Siqi Sun. Currently I am  a doctoral student at the department of computer science in University of Exeter.I received my master degree in information security from China University of Geosciences. Keeping up to date with advances in computing technology has become somewhat of hobby for me. This love for technology, in turn, led to a love for the world of information security. My research interests mainly lie in steganography & steganalysis, trustworthy network, information security, cryptography and other related specialized areas.

My research mainly focuses on how to construct novel CNN architectures and strategies to improve the detection percentages of steganographic images on the last generation algorithms both in spatial and frequency (JPEG) domains. On top of that, steganalysis issues in practical application scenarios is studied and explored to meet the need of detection under complex environment. It is also worth paying attention to whether the field characteristics more suitable for steganalysis can
be explored in combination with the research hotspots in the field of deep learning.

If youâ€™d like to know more about my work or explore opportunities for collaboration, please get in touch!
I am currently working on PyTorch Compilers
at Facebook.
Before Facebook, I was at GoDaddy helping build a deep learning platform
for predicting small business behavior and personalizing experiences across
the company.  I also created [GoDaddy Domain Appraisals], which uses neural
networks to predict the resale value of a domain name better than a human
expert.  I joined GoDaddy in 2013 as part of the [acquisition] of the startup
[Locu], which I joined in 2011 while I was simultaneously getting my Ph.D. at
[MIT][MIT] [CSAIL].
I did my Ph.D. dissertation in the [Commit] group lead by  [Saman Amarasinghe].
I started the [OpenTuner] project, an extensible framework for program
autotuning.  I also created the [PetaBricks] programming language, a language
that incorporates algorithmic choices to allow an integrated autotuner to
explore search spaces of program implementations.  As an undergraduate, I did
research with [Gene Cooperman] and helped create [DMTCP], a user-level
distributed checkpoint/restart system.
