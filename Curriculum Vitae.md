# Side Projects

## Algorithmic Trading on LendingClub.com

Since 2012 I've been doing algorithmic trading on the secondary market of
the peer-to-peer lending platform [LendingClub]. I use neural networks to
predict the likelihood of default of specific loans, and then both buy and sell
notes based on those predictions. The latest version of this is not open
source because there is a limited supply of notes available on the secondary
market. In the first few years, this was very profitable; however, recently,
other players have entered the market.  Good deals disappear within seconds,
and overall yields and volumes have fallen. To be competitive, you increasingly
need to focus on the speed of your algorithm.
